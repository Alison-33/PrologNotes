# Prolog Study Notes

### Statements and procedures
- Prolog programs consist of collections of **statements** (also called assertions, or clauses)
- Statements are grouped into **procedures**. 
- Each procedure defines a certain relationship between its **arguments**.

### Facts and rules
- **Facts** are propositions declared to be True
